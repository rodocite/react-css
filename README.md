# React / Webpack / Rails build
 - By default; localized, programmatically BEM'd CSS to avoid namespace collisions
   - Regular old CSS modules, no hacks
   - Easy sharing of global CSS (will localize custom styles based on global styles for you)

```
$ npm run build
$ bin/rails server
$ open http://localhost:3000
```
